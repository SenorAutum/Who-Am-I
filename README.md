## About The Project

This portfolio was designed to be a unique and memorable way to showcase skills, projects, and background information. Instead of a traditional layout, it embraces a "Developer's Terminal" theme, allowing users to navigate the content by 'executing' shell commands. 

The entire interactive experience is built using only HTML and CSS, leveraging modern CSS features to create a dynamic feel without JavaScript.

## Built With

This project is built with fundamental web technologies, focusing on modern and efficient practices.

    * **Flexbox:** For aligning items in the terminal header and body.
    * **Custom Properties (Variables):** For a maintainable and easily themeable color scheme.
